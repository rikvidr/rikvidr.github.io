haha
just so you know, a LOT of these horrorcore albums in FLAC are not actually lossless.
many horrorcore rappers dont record in lossless WAV, they save their music as mp3
so when I rip the CD, it's not studio quality, its mp3 preserved as FLAC

2016-08-06 15:31
Mirovoe Zlo
oh yeah??? like what

2016-08-06 15:32
Tom Rikvidr
almost all of it lol.

2016-08-06 15:32

i haven't set up an FTP in the past 10 years, so i've been looking around the settings

2016-08-06 19:26
Mirovoe Zlo
how long have you been online with your ftp server?

2016-08-06 19:27
Tom Rikvidr
I set it up yesterday when SLSK wasn't working for you haha.
the last time I had an FTP server was when I ran Killwarez back in 2007.

2016-08-06 19:27
Mirovoe Zlo
Killwarez what is this?

2016-08-06 19:28
Tom Rikvidr
Back in 2005-2006 there was a warez site called NuWarez. A lot of the moderators/administrators were juggalos, so the site had a lot of juggalo music.

2016-08-06 19:28
Mirovoe Zlo
oh i remeber that ste

2016-08-06 19:29
Tom Rikvidr
I was a moderator, but I left, and decided to start my own site, and I named it Killwarez. It was just a Horrorcore download site.
But then some things happened, and I couldn't do it anymore.

2016-08-06 19:33

Tom Rikvidr<br>
haha<br>
just so you know, a LOT of these horrorcore albums in FLAC are not actually lossless.<br>
many horrorcore rappers dont record in lossless WAV, they save their music as mp3<br>
so when I rip the CD, it's not studio quality, its mp3 preserved as FLAC<br><br>

2016-08-06 15:31<br>
Mirovoe Zlo<br>
oh yeah??? like what<br><br>

2016-08-06 15:32<br>

2016-08-06 19:26<br>
Mirovoe Zlo<br>
how long have you been online with your ftp server?<br><br>

2016-08-06 19:27<br>
Tom Rikvidr<br>
I set it up yesterday when SLSK wasn't working for you haha.<br>
the last time I had an FTP server was when I ran Killwarez back in 2007.<br><br>

2016-08-06 19:27<br>
Mirovoe Zlo<br>
Killwarez what is this?<br><br>

2016-08-06 19:28<br>
Tom Rikvidr<br>
Back in 2005-2006 there was a warez site called NuWarez. A lot of the moderators/administrators were juggalos, so the site had a lot of juggalo music.<br><br>

2016-08-06 19:28<br>
Mirovoe Zlo<br>
oh i remeber that ste<br><br>

2016-08-06 19:29<br>
Tom Rikvidr<br>
I was a moderator, but I left, and decided to start my own site, and I named it Killwarez. It was just a Horrorcore download site.<br>
But then some things happened, and I couldn't do it anymore.<br><br>
